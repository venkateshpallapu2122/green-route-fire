# **App Name**: EcoRoute AI

## Core Features:

- Dashboard: Display an interactive dashboard with key metrics such as total vehicles, optimized routes, estimated fuel saved, and estimated CO2 reduced.
- Route Optimization: Allow users to input origin and destination addresses, as well as vehicle capacity, to simulate route optimization and display it on a map, showing estimated fuel consumption and CO2 emissions.
- Fleet Management: Enable users to manage their fleet by adding new vehicles, each with a name, type, and simulated health status.
- Sustainability Reports: Present sustainability reports with total fuel saved, total CO2 reduced, and average fuel efficiency, displayed in both summary cards and detailed tables.
- Settings: Implement a settings panel where users can add sample vehicles and routes for demonstration purposes.
- AI-Powered Route Simulation: The LLM uses road network data to generate an efficient route, incorporating real-time traffic and vehicle parameters. This route reflects current environmental considerations, adjusting dynamically based on the user's vehicle specifications and immediate feedback.
- Responsiveness and Data Persistence: The application should be responsive web design and each section of application should be dynamic and changes should be rendered back into database or firestore and the maps should work live

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep forest green (#386641) for a sense of sustainability and nature.
- Background color: Light, desaturated green (#f6f6f3).
- Accent color: Earthy yellow (#D6AD60), a natural complement to green that represents the sun and warmth, useful for highlighting important UI elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a clean and modern look throughout the app.
- Use simple, line-based icons to represent vehicles, routes, and sustainability metrics.
- Maintain a clean and well-spaced layout to allow easy readability and comprehension, with a focus on mobile responsiveness.
- Subtle transitions and animations on UI elements (buttons, cards) to provide a smooth and engaging user experience.
